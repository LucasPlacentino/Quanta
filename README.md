# Quanta Mechanical Keyboard
Custom hot-swap 75% ISO keyboard with integrated USB hub including one vertical upward-facing USB A port for Windows Hello fingerprint readers.  

### Project advancement : [Quanta's Github Project](https://github.com/orgs/ObsiLab/projects/2)  

## Documentation
Documentation about Quanta can be found on [the Quanta website: quanta.obsilab.com](https://quanta.obsilab.com).

## PCB
Quanta exists in multiple versions:
- RP2040 Stamp microcontroller board by Solder Party
  - General components
  - JLCPCB assembly service optimized BOM
- RPi Pico microcontroller board
  - General components
  - JLCPCB assembly service optimized components
- Bare RP2040 microcontroller chip
  - General components
  - JLCPCB assembly service optimized components

All of them are using SMD components but no smaller than 0603 and on hand-solderable pads (a complete through-hole PCB could be coming next ðŸ‘€). A PCB assembly service is still recommended.

[rmk_firmware](https://github.com/ObsiLab/rmk_firmware) _WIP_  
RMK is a keyboard firmware written in Rust, inspired by QMK or KMK. Originally built for the Quanta.

QMK config for the Quanta: _WIP_  

VIA config for the Quanta: _WIP_  

VIAL config for the Quanta: _WIP_
